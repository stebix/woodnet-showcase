# `woodnet` Showcase

This repository containes additional showcase information in the form of tutorials and visualizations for our IAWA paper manuscript [TODO: INSERT TITLE] and the accompanying advanced computed tomography data processing and classification pipeline [`woodnet`](https://github.com/stebix/woodnet).
The visualizations are bundled nito a Jupyter notebook that can be viewed and handled interactively. Core showcased elements are 3D volumetric visualizations that are not a good fit for paper- and PDF-based static imagery.
To look at the generated visualizations and explantations, please launch the binder notebook direcntly in your browser via the button below:

The secondary turorial is concerned with a short explanation of the default data layout utilized in the `woodnet` data processing and classification pipeline. For this, use the secondary link:

> [!TIP]
> Binder only provides CPU compute resources for the notebooks. Using a CPU with volumetric data and 3D ResNet can be slow.
> If the compute resources or your patience time out, just use the Jupyter notebook as a starting point for running experiments
> on your own premises using a faster GPU resource.
